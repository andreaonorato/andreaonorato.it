    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Software Engineer Salary Analysis in Europe</h1>
<p>This study explores <b>software engineer salaries</b>, <b>tax implications</b>, and <b>savings potential</b> across Europe, helping professionals make informed career and relocation decisions.</p>
<p>This study has been carried out by <strong>Andrea Onorato</strong>. Connect on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrea-onorato-3b1664245/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> or visit <a href="https://andreaonorato.it" target="_blank">my website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-was-the-study-conducted" style="text-align: center;">How was the study conducted?</h2>
<p>The salaries have been extracted from <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com"><b>Glassdoor</b></a> through <b>web scraping</b>. The data was then processed, <b>normalized to EUR</b>, and cleaned by removing incorrect salary entries based on a specific algorithm.</p>
<p>For the tax analysis, <b>official tax calculators</b> from trusted government websites and other reliable sources were used to compute the <b>gross-to-net salary</b> for a <i>35-year-old, medium-frugal individual</i>, working the standard weekly hours in their country, unmarried, childless, and without religious obligations.</p>
<p>To estimate the <b>savings rate</b>, cost of living data was sourced from <a href="https://www.numbeo.com"><b>Numbeo</b></a>.</p>

<h1 id="results" style="text-align: center;">Results (full analysis is below)</h1>

<h2 id="highest-earning">üí∞ What to do if you aim to earn the most money?</h2>
<p>Move to a <b>Low Cost Of Living (LCOL)</b> country with <b>low taxes</b>, such as <b>Poland or Portugal</b>, and work for a company based in <b>Switzerland or the USA</b>.</p>

<h2 id="no-remote">üè¢ What if you do not want to work remotely?</h2>
<p>Move to either <b>Switzerland</b> or <b>Poland</b>. These countries offer the <b>highest Purchasing Power Index (PPI)</b>. Try to secure a job in <b>big tech</b> or <b>finance</b> for the best pay. If top-tier companies are out of reach, consider medium-sized firms in <b>Denmark</b> and the <b>UK</b>.</p>

<h2 id="ppi-vs-savings">üìà PPI vs. Savings Rate?</h2>
<p>It depends on your goals. If you plan to settle permanently (e.g., <i>buying a house, starting a family</i>), you should prioritize a <b>high-PPI country</b>. However, if you prefer flexibility, focusing on a <b>high-savings-rate country</b> is a smarter choice.</p>

<h2 id="work-life-balance">‚öñÔ∏è What if you really aim for the best work-life balance?</h2>
<p>Countries like <b>Switzerland</b> and the <b>UK</b> offer high salaries but often demand <i>long working hours</i>. In contrast, countries like <b>Denmark</b> and the <b>Netherlands</b> provide a strong balance between <b>salary and work-life harmony</b>.</p>

<h2 id="tax-impact">üí∏ Does tax burden significantly affect savings?</h2>
<p><b>Yes.</b> Tax rates vary widely across Europe, significantly impacting your <b>net salary</b> and savings. Countries like <b>Switzerland, Ireland, and Poland</b> have <i>relatively lower tax burdens</i>, whereas nations like <b>France</b> or <b>Belgium</b> impose much higher taxes. Relocating strategically based on tax policies can <b>greatly enhance disposable income</b>.</p>

<h2 id="job-opportunities">üìä Do salaries correlate with job opportunities?</h2>
<p>Not always. Countries offering the <b>highest salaries</b>, such as <b>Switzerland</b>, often have <i>stricter immigration laws</i> and <i>fewer job openings</i> for non-residents. In contrast, countries like <b>Germany</b> and the <b>Netherlands</b> have <i>more job opportunities</i> due to their large economies and international hiring policies.</p>

<h2 id="emerging-markets">üåç Which emerging countries offer the best tech salary growth potential?</h2>

<p><b>Poland and Portugal.</b> In Poland in the past years salaries have been growing so fast and many global companies outsource here, plus a growing startup ecosystem is booming. Salary increases will continue due to <b>EU investments</b> and nearshoring.
Portugal is increasing number of tech hubs (Lisbon, Porto) attractive for digital nomands and startups. Plus nice government tax incentives for expats.</p>

    </div>

    <h2>5. Show salary standard deviation across countries</h2>
    <p>A measure of salary variability within each country. A high standard deviation indicates a greater disparity between the lowest and highest salaries. High standard deviation means that there are many outliers, i.e. many companies that pays a lot more/less than the average. Low standard deviation means that salaries are quite fixed, no much room for super high or super low salaries</p>

    <h1 id="limitations" style="text-align: center;">Limitations</h1>
    <p>While <b>Glassdoor</b> provides valuable salary insights, it is not a <i>perfect</i> data source. The dataset includes <i>historical salaries</i> from when Glassdoor was first established, meaning <b>older salaries</b> are still present, potentially skewing results.</p>
    <p><b>Tax calculations</b> are highly complex and depend on numerous personal factors such as <i>marital status, dependents, additional income sources, and deductions</i>. This study assumes a <b><i>35-year-old unmarried male</i></b>, which may not be representative of all individuals.</p>
    <p><b>Cost of living</b> is another variable that can significantly impact savings. Here, a <i>medium-frugal lifestyle</i> was assumed, but <b>individual spending habits</b> vary widely. The results could change substantially if a <i>different lifestyle</i> were considered.</p>

    <h1 id="future-work" style="text-align: center;">Future Work</h1>
    <p>To improve accuracy, acquiring <b>more up-to-date</b> and <b>granular salary data</b> from multiple sources beyond <i>Glassdoor</i> could help refine the analysis.</p>
    <p>Further research could incorporate a <b>more dynamic taxation model</b> that adjusts for <i>different personal and financial circumstances</i>, making tax estimates more precise.</p>
    <p>It would also be interesting to explore the <b>impact of different lifestyle choices</b> on savings and financial well-being. A <i>sensitivity analysis</i> varying <b>cost of living assumptions</b> could provide deeper insights into how <b>lifestyle affects purchasing power</b> and <b>net savings</b> in different countries.</p>
